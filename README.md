# about kerjakan

Indonesia is a Travel and Hospitality Mogul in South East Asia. Leasure and Culture is part of our economic drive. Unfortunately this year this industry is mostly declining, as the global pandemic forces business, hotels, and services deemed non-essential to shut down, leaving hundred-thousands of workforce unable to perform their skill, and consumers unable to get the services they want.

With Kerjakan, we want to connect those who have the skillsets and whose who seek for leisure and convenience service at their home, so those people with different skillsets can work and move the economy. We believe that every work is essential to the community, and the economy. Semua bisa dikerjakan!
